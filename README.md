Our goal in this meetup is to test `word2vec` and its successor, `GloVe`.

Is $king - man + woman = queen$ a lucky result that makes for a cute headline?


Moreover,
- how do you write good tests for this or future vector-space models of semantics?
- what kinds of relationships do various words even have in +able and ×able (vector & inner-product) space?



As a first pass we will review some of the blogposts out of Stanford NLP, Berkeley data sci, etc. on `word2vec`, and then write our own test suite.


Please ask your friends who like wordplay, analogies, and lateral thinking to come up with "equations" like $king − man + woman = queen$. Once the test suite structure is defined, we should be able to add more good ideas pretty easily.
