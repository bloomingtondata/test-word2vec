#require(superheat)
#require(rword2vec) #and others


###### Purpose

We want to test Google's famous `word2vec` result $\mathrm{king} - \mathrm{man} + \mathrm{woman} = \mathrm{queen}$. This particular result fits our semantic intuition, but how many other equations come as close?



###### Tolerance

Chris wants to make

```{r}
close <- .1
message(close, "should be as close as king - man + woman.")
close -> good.enough

close.but.not.close.enough <- .5
messages("how to index ", close.but.not.close.enough, "? maybe a slider in a sh.")


too.far <- 5
message(too.far, " should be so far out that ridiculous non-results would be inclued if you (fairly) included the spheres of distance ", too.far)
```
